Investigating Netflix Movies: A 1990s Exploratory Analysis
Project Overview

This project revisits and extends an exploratory data analysis of Netflix movie data with a focused lens on the 1990s decade (1990–1999). The objective is to understand how movie durations and genre patterns looked before the rise of streaming-era content, and to identify trends in short-form movies, particularly within the Action genre.

The project has been updated with improved data cleaning, clearer feature definitions, and more structured visual analysis.

Key Questions

The analysis seeks to answer the following:

What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s?

How common were short movies (less than 90 minutes) during this decade?

How many short Action movies were released in the 1990s?

How does movie duration vary across genres and release years?

Dataset

File: netflix_data.csv

Scope: Netflix titles metadata

Key fields used:

title

genre

release_year

duration

type

Only movies were included in this analysis; TV shows were excluded.

Data Preparation

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

Filtered the dataset to include only movies

Isolated movies released between 1990 and 1999

Converted duration values from strings (e.g., "90 min") to integers

Defined a short movie as one with a duration under 90 minutes

These steps ensured numerical accuracy and consistency in the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA includes:

Distribution analysis of movie durations in the 1990s

Identification of the mode (most frequent duration) for the decade

Genre-based segmentation, with a focus on Action movies

A scatter plot visualizing movie duration vs. release year, with genre-based color coding

Visualization

Movie Duration by Year of Release

X-axis: Release Year

Y-axis: Duration (minutes)

Colors indicate genre categories (Children, Documentaries, Stand-Up, Other)

This visualization highlights long-term duration trends and the emergence of shorter formats in specific genres.

Key Results

Most frequent movie duration in the 1990s: stored as duration

Number of short Action movies in the 1990s: stored as short_movie_count

These values summarize the core findings and serve as reference points for further exploration.

Future Improvements

Extend analysis to other decades for comparison

Perform genre-wise duration trend analysis

Introduce interactive visualizations

Build a dashboard summarizing decade-level insights

Conclusion

This project demonstrates structured exploratory data analysis, careful data preprocessing, and meaningful visualization to uncover historical trends in movie duration. By focusing on the 1990s, it provides a useful contrast to modern streaming-era content patterns and highlights the evolution of short-form movies.
