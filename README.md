# Netflix Movies Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a Netflix movies dataset to gain insights into durations, genres, and patterns of movies released over the years.  
The analysis focuses on understanding movies by **decades**, **genres**, and **duration**, along with visualizations to support data-driven insights.

## Dataset
- **File:** `netflix_data.csv`  
- **Source:** Publicly available Netflix dataset (e.g., Kaggle)  
- **Columns include:**  
  - `Title` – Name of the movie  
  - `Genre` – Movie genre  
  - `Duration` – Movie duration in minutes  
  - `Release_Year` – Year of release  
  - `Director` – Director of the movie  
  - `Country` – Country of origin  
  - `Rating` – Movie rating (if available)  

## Features & Analysis
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect entries  
- **Decade Analysis:** Analyze movies released in specific decades (e.g., 1990s) for patterns  
- **Duration Analysis:** Identify the most frequent movie duration  
- **Genre Analysis:** Count of movies per genre and identification of short movies (<90 minutes) in each genre  
- **Visualization:**  
  - Histograms for movie duration  
  - Bar charts for genre frequency  
  - Scatterplots for year vs duration trends  

## Key Insights
- Most frequent movie duration in the 1990s: `duration` minutes (replace with your calculated value)  
- Number of short action movies in the 1990s: `count` (replace with your calculated value)  
- Top genres in each decade and duration trends  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** – Main programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis
